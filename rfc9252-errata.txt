RFC 9252 erratta text (Ref: https://github.com/ietf-wg-idr/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ct/issues/5)
==========================================================================================

Section 4 states: 

   To achieve efficient packing, this document allows either 1) the
   encoding of the SRv6 Service SID as a whole in the SRv6 Services TLVs
   or 2) the encoding of only the common part of the SRv6 SID (e.g.,
   Locator) in the SRv6 Services TLVs and the encoding of the variable
   (e.g., Function or Argument parts) in the existing label fields
   specific to that service encoding.  This later form of encoding is
   referred to as the Transposition Scheme, where the SRv6 SID Structure
   Sub-Sub-TLV describes the sizes of the parts of the SRv6 SID and also
   indicates the offset of the variable part along with its length in
   the SRv6 SID value.  The use of the Transposition Scheme is
   RECOMMENDED for the specific service encodings that allow it, as
   described further in Sections 5 and 6.

Section 5.1 further states: 

5.1.  IPv4 VPN over SRv6 Core

   The MP_REACH_NLRI over SRv6 core is encoded according to IPv4 VPN
   unicast over IPv6 core defined in [RFC8950].

   The label field of IPv4-VPN NLRI is encoded as specified in [RFC8277]
   with the 20-bit Label Value set to the whole or a portion of the
   Function part of the SRv6 SID when the Transposition Scheme of
   encoding (Section 4) is used; otherwise, it is set to Implicit NULL.
   When using the Transposition Scheme, the Transposition Length MUST be
   less than or equal to 20 and less than or equal to the FL.

Problem:

These procedures may cause incorrect routing in the following scenario:


                         RR1--+
                                \  +-------R2  [MPLS + SRv6]
                                 \ |
                         R1--------P-------R3  [MPLS only]
                   [MPLS + SRv6]   |
                                   +-------R4  [SRv6 only]

                     <---- Bidirectional Traffic ---->

            Figure: BGP L3VPN Interop between MPLS and SRv6 nodes

            This example shows a provider network with a mix of devices with
            different forwarding capabilities.  R1 and R2 support forwarding both
            MPLS and SRv6 packets. R3 supports forwarding MPLS packets only.  R4
            supports forwarding SRv6 packets only. All these nodes have BGP
            session with Route Reflector RR1 which reflects routes between these
            nodes with nexthop unchanged. BGP L3VPN (SAFI 128) family is negotiated 
            on these sessions.
            
            If SRv6 nodes R2, R1, R4 use Transposition Scheme described in RFC 9252, it will 
            cause misrouting at R3 because of misinterpretation of the MPLS label field. 
            Because of Transposition scheme, RFC 8277 encoded MPLS label field is not 
            containing a valid MPLS label. 

            RFC 9252 should caution against use of Transposition Scheme in brownfield 
            deployments where all nodes may not support SRv6.
