    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "Intent Driven
      Service Mapping" to express association of overlay routes with underlay
      routes satisfying a certain SLA using BGP. The document describes a
      framework for classifying underlay routes into transport classes and
      mapping service routes to a specific transport class.</t>

      <t>The "Transport class" construct maps to a desired SLA and can be used
      to realize the "Topology Slice" in 5G Network slicing architecture.</t>

      <t>This document specifies BGP protocol procedures that enable
      dissemination of such service mapping information that may span multiple
      cooperating administrative domains. These domains may be administered by
      the same provider or by closely co-ordinating provider networks.</t>

      <t>A new BGP transport layer address family (SAFI 76) is defined for
      this purpose that uses RFC-4364 technology and follows RFC-8277 NLRI
      encoding. This new address family is called "BGP Classful Transport",
      aka BGP CT.</t>

      <t>BGP CT makes it possible to advertise multiple tunnels to the same
      destination address, thus avoiding need of multiple loopbacks on the
      egress node.</t>

      <t>It carries transport prefixes across tunnel domain boundaries (e.g.
      in Inter-AS Option-C networks), which is parallel to BGP LU (SAFI 4). It
      disseminates "Transport class" information for the transport prefixes
      across the participating domains, which is not possible with BGP LU.
      This makes the end-to-end network a "Transport Class" aware tunneled
      network.</t>

      <t>Just like BGP LU (SAFI 4), BGP CT family (SAFI 76) is used in
      inter-AS option-C networks. The Service Mapping procedures described in
      this document apply in the same manner to Intra-AS service endpoints as
      well as Inter-AS option-A, option-B, option-C variations. Examples of
      these variations are given in Appendix A.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The mechanisms defined in this document enable brownfield networks
      deployed using existing technologies like RSVP-TE and greenfield
      networks that use technologies like SPRING to achieve 'Intent Driven
      Service Mapping'.</t>

      <t>To facilitate this, the tunnels in a network can be grouped by the
      purpose they serve into a "Transport Class". These tunnels could be
      created using any signaling protocol including but not limited to LDP,
      RSVP-TE, BGP LU or SPRING. The tunnels may use MPLS, IPv4 or IPv6
      forwarding and carry one of the signaled payload types (e.g. MPLS).
      Tunnels may exist between different pair of endpoints. Multiple tunnels
      may exist between the same pair of endpoints.</t>

      <t>A Transport Class consists of tunnels created by various protocols
      that satisfy the properties of the class. For example, a "Gold"
      transport class may consist of tunnels that traverse the shortest path
      with fast re-route protection. A "Silver" transport class may hold
      tunnels that traverse shortest paths without protection. A "To NbrAS
      Foo" transport class may hold tunnels that exit to neighboring AS Foo
      and so on.</t>

      <t>The extensions specified in this document can be used to create a BGP
      transport tunnel that potentially spans domains while preserving its
      Transport Class. Examples of domain are Autonomous System (AS) or IGP
      area. Within each domain, there is a second level underlay tunnel used
      by BGP to cross the domain. The second level underlay tunnels could be
      heterogeneous; each domain may use a different type of tunnel (e.g.
      MPLS, IP, GRE or SRv6) and use a different signaling mechanism. A domain
      boundary is demarcated by a rewrite of BGP nexthop to 'self' while
      readvertising BGP CT transport routes. Examples of domain boundary are
      inter-AS links and inter-region ABRs. The path uses MPLS label-switching
      when crossing domain boundaries and uses the native intra-AS tunnel of
      the desired transport class when traversing within a domain.</t>

      <t>Overlay routes carry sufficient indication of the desired Transport
      Classes in the form of a BGP community called the "Mapping community".
      The "route resolution" procedure on the ingress node selects an
      appropriate tunnel whose destination matches (LPM) the nexthop of the
      overlay route belonging to the corresponding Transport Class. If the
      overlay route is carried in BGP, the protocol nexthop (or PNH) is
      carried as an attribute of the route.</t>

      <t>The PNH of the overlay route is also referred to as "Service
      Endpoint" (SEP). The SEP may exist in the same domain as the service
      ingress node or lie in a different domain, which is adjacent or
      non-adjacent. In the former case, reachability to the SEP is provided by
      an intra-domain tunneling protocol and in the latter case, reachability
      to the SEP is via BGP transport families (e.g. SAFI 4 or 76).</t>

      <t>In this architecture, the intra-domain transport protocols (e.g.
      RSVP-TE, SRTE) are also "Transport Class aware". They publish ingress
      routes in the Transport Route Database associated with the Transport
      Class at the tunnel ingress node. These routes are used to resolve BGP
      routes including BGP CT which may be further readvertised to adjacent
      domains to extend this tunnel. How exactly the transport protocols are
      made transport class aware is outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This document describes mechanisms to: <list>
          <t>Model a "Transport Class" as a "Transport Route Database" on a
          router and to collect tunnel ingress routes of a certain class.</t>

          <t>Enable service routes to resolve over an intended Transport Class
          by virtue of carrying the appropriate "Mapping Community", which
          results in using the corresponding Transport Route Database for
          finding nexthop reachability.</t>

          <t>Publish tunnel ingress routes in a Transport Route Database via
          BGP without any path hiding using BGP VPN and Add-path procedures,
          such that overlay routes in the receiving domains can also resolve
          over tunnels of the associated Transport Class.</t>

          <t>Provide a way for cooperating domains to reconcile any
          differences in extended community namespaces and interoperate
          between different transport signaling protocols in each domain.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In this document we focus mainly on MPLS as the intra-domain
      transport tunnel forwarding technology, but the mechanisms described
      here would work in similar manner for non-MPLS (e.g. IP, GRE, UDP or
      SRv6) transport tunnel forwarding technologies too.</t>

      <t>This document assumes MPLS forwarding as the de facto standard when
      crossing domain boundaries. However mechanisms specified in this
      document can also support different forwarding technologies (e.g. SRv6).
      Section 17 (SRv6 support) in this document describes the application of
      BGP CT over SRv6 data plane.</t>

      <t>This document realizes "Intent" as defined in <xref
      target="RFC9315">Intent-based Networking: Concepts and Definitions
      </xref> and prescribes procedures that use the transport class as a
      construct to express intent. The procedures defined in this document
      provide homogenous building blocks to achieve Intent-based
      Networking.</t>

      <t>The document <xref target="Intent-Routing-Color">Intent-aware Routing
      using Color</xref> describes various use cases and applications of
      procedures described in this document.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Transport Class">
      <t>A Transport Class is defined as a set of transport tunnels that share
      the same SLA. It is encoded as the Transport Class RT, which is a new
      Route-Target extended community.</t>

      <t>A Transport Class is configured at SN and BN with RD and Route Target
      attributes. Creation of a Transport Class instantiates its corresponding
      Transport Route Database.</t>

      <t>The operator may configure an SN/BN to classify a tunnel into an
      appropriate Transport Class, which causes the tunnel's ingress route to
      be installed in the corresponding Transport Route Database. These routes
      are used to resolve BGP routes including BGP CT which may be further
      readvertised to adjacent domains to extend this tunnel.</t>

      <t>Alternatively, a router receiving the transport routes in BGP with
      appropriate signaling information can associate those ingress routes to
      the appropriate Transport Class. E.g. for Classful Transport family
      (SAFI 76) routes, the Transport Class RT indicates the Transport Class.
      For BGP LU family (SAFI 4) routes, import processing based on
      Communities or inter-AS source-peer may be used to place the route in
      the desired Transport Class.</t>

      <t>When the ingress route is received via <xref
      target="SRTE">SRTE</xref> with "Color:Endpoint" as the NLRI that encodes
      the Transport Class as an integer 'Color', the 'Color' is mapped to a
      Transport Class during import processing. SRTE ingress route for
      'Endpoint' is installed in the corresponding Transport Route Database.
      The SRTE tunnel will be extended by a BGP CT advertisement with NLRI
      'RD:Endpoint', Transport Class RT and a new label. The MPLS swap route
      thus installed for the new label will pop the label and deliver
      decapsulated traffic into the path determined by SRTE route.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC8664">RFC8664</xref> extends PCEP to carry SRTE
      Color. This color association learnt from PCEP is also mapped to a
      Transport Class thus associating the PCEP signaled SRTE LSP with the
      desired Transport Class.</t>

      <t>Similarly, <xref target="PCEP-RSVP-COLOR">PCEP-RSVP-COLOR</xref>
      extends PCEP to carry RSVP Color. This color association learnt from
      PCEP is also mapped to a Transport Class thus associating the PCEP
      signaled RSVP-TE LSP with the desired Transport Class.</t>

      <t>This document defines a new type of Route Target, called "Transport

      <t>The "Transport class" Route Target Extended community follows the
      mechanisms for VPN route import/export as specified in <xref
      target="RFC4364">BGP VPN</xref> and follows the Constrained Route

      <t>A BGP speaker that implements RT Constraint <xref

      <t>The Transport Class Route Target Extended community is carried on
      Classful Transport family routes and allows associating them with

    </section>

    <section title="Transport Route Database">
      <t>A Transport Route Database is a logical collection of transport
      routes pertaining to the same Transport Class. Tunnel endpoint addresses
      in this database belong to the "Provider Namespace".</t>

      <t>Overlay routes that want to use a specific Transport Class confine
      the scope of nexthop resolution to the set of routes contained in the
      corresponding Transport Route Database.</t>

      <t>The Transport Route Database can be realized as a "Routing Table"
      referred in <eref
      target="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-9.1.2.1">Section
      9.1.2.1 of RFC4271</eref> which is a control plane only database.
      However, an implementation may choose a different methodology to realize
      this logical construct in such a way that it supports the procedures
      defined in this document.</t>

      <t>SN or BN originate routes for 'Classful Transport' address family
      from the Transport Route Database. These routes have NLRI "RD:Endpoint",
      Transport Class RT and an MPLS label. 'Classful Transport' family routes
      received with Transport Class RT are imported into its corresponding
      Transport Route Database.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Nexthop_Resoln_Schm" title="Nexthop Resolution Scheme">
      <t>This section defines the Nexthop Resolution Scheme construct that is
      used to specify how a service route or a BGP CT route can resolve its
      nexthop using its associated Mapping Community over a specific TRDB or
      an ordered set of TRDBs.</t>

      <t>An implementation may provide an option for the service route to
      resolve over less preferred Transport Classes, should the resolution
      over preferred or "primary" Transport Class fail.</t>

      <t>To accomplish this, the set of service routes may be associated with
      a user-configured "Resolution Scheme" that consists of the primary
      Transport Class and an optional ordered list of fallback Transport
      Classes.</t>

      <t>A community known as "Mapping Community" is configured for a
      "resolution scheme". Mapping community is a "role" and not a new type of
      community; any BGP community or extended community may play this role. A
      Mapping Community maps to exactly one Resolution Scheme. A Resolution
      Scheme comprises of one primary transport class and optionally, one or
      more fallback transport classes. The Resolution Scheme is used to
      realize the desired Intent.</t>

      <t>An example of mapping community is color:0:100, described in <xref
      target="RFC9012">RFC 9012</xref>, or the transport-target:0:100
      described in section 4 in this document.</t>

      <t>A BGP route is associated with a resolution scheme during import
      processing. The first community on the route that matches a Mapping
      Community of a locally configured Resolution Scheme is considered the
      effective Mapping Community for the route. The Resolution Scheme thus
      found is used when resolving the route's PNH. If a route contains more
      than one Mapping Community, it indicates that the route considers these
      distinct Mapping Communities as equivalent in Intent. So, the first
      community that maps to a Resolution Scheme is chosen as the effective
      mapping community.</t>

      <t>A transport route received in BGP Classful Transport family SHOULD
      use a Resolution Scheme that contains the primary Transport Class
      without any fallback to best effort tunnels. The primary Transport Class
      is identified by the Transport Class RT carried on the route. Thus,
      Transport Class RT serves as the Mapping Community for BGP CT
      routes.</t>

      <t>A service route received in a BGP service family MAY map to a
      Resolution Scheme that contains the primary Transport Class identified
      by the Mapping Community on the route and a fallback to best effort
      Transport Class. The primary Transport Class is identified by the
      Mapping Community carried on the route. For e.g. the Extended Color
      community may serve as the Mapping Community for service routes.
      Color:0:&lt;n&gt; MAY map to a Resolution Scheme that has primary
      Transport Class &lt;n&gt; and a fallback to best-effort Transport
      Class.</t>

      <t>The Resolution Scheme mechanism not only works with SPRING transport
      protocols to realize Intent based forwarding, but also with existing
      tunneling technologies like RSVP TE, GRE, UDP, etc. Not assuming a
      specific tunneling technology makes the BGP CT architecture backward and
      forward compatible with existing and newer tunneling protocols,
      respectively. It is compatible with SPRING, but there is no specific
      dependency on SPRING. It is more generic and has broader
      applicability.</t>

    <section title="BGP Classful Transport Family NLRI">
      <t>The Classful Transport (CT) family will use the existing AFI of IPv4

         Fig 2: SAFI 76 "Classful Transport" NLRI

 Length: 1 octet

    The Length field consists of a single octet.  It specifies the
    length in bits of the remainder of the NLRI field.

    Note that the length will always be the sum of 20 (number of bits
    in Label field), plus 3 (number of bits in Rsrv field), plus 1
    (number of bits in S field), plus the length in bits of the
    Prefix (RD:IP prefix).

    In an MP_REACH_NLRI attribute whose SAFI is 76, the Prefix
    (RD + IP prefix) will be 96 bits or less if the AFI is 1
    and will be 192 bits or less if the AFI is 2.

    As specified in [RFC4760], the actual length of the NLRI field
    will be the number of bits specified in the Length field, rounded
    up to the nearest integral number of octets.

 Label:

     The Label field is a 20-bit field containing an MPLS label value
     (see [RFC3032]).

 Rsrv:

     This 3-bit field SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be
     ignored on reception.

 S:
     When single label is advertised, this 1-bit field MUST be set to
     one on transmission and MUST be ignored on reception.


 Route Distinguisher:

     8 byte RD as defined in [RFC4364 Sec 4.2].

 IPv4/IPv6 Prefix:

    IPv4 prefix, if AFI/SAFI 1/76.
    IPv6 prefix, if AFI/SAFI 2/76.

    <section title="Usage of Route Distinguisher and Label Allocation Modes">
      <t>RD aids in troubleshooting a BGP CT network by uniquely identifying
      the originator of a route across a multi domain network.</t>

      <t>Use of RD also allows the option for signaling forwarding diversity
      within the same Transport Class. The same Egress PE can advertise
      multiple BGP CT routes for an EP belonging to the same Transport
      Class.</t>

      <t>E.g. multiple RDx:EP1 prefixes can be advertised for an EP1 to
      different set of BGP peers in order to collect traffic statistics for
      them. In absence of RD, duplicated Transport Class/Color values will be
      needed in the transport network to achieve such use cases.</t>

      <t>In a BGP CT network, the number of routes at an Ingress PE is a
      function of unique EPs multiplied by BNs in the ingress domain that do
      nexthop self. BGP CT provides flexible RD and Label allocation modes to
      address operational requirements in a multi-domain network.</t>

      <t>The allocation of RD is done at the point of origin of the BGP CT
      route. This can either be an Egress SN or a BN. The default RD
      allocation mode is to use a unique RD per originating node for an EP.
      This mode allows for the ingress to uniquely identify each originated
      path. Alternatively, the same RD may be provisioned for multiple
      originators of the same EP. This mode can be used when the ingress does
      not require full visibility of all nodes originating an EP.</t>

      <t>A label is allocated for a BGP CT route when it is advertised with
      nexthop self by a SN or a BN. An implementation may use different label
      allocation modes with BGP CT. The recommended label allocation mode is
      per-prefix as it provides better traffic convergence properties than
      per-nexthop label allocation mode. Furthermore, BGP CT offers two
      flavors for per-prefix label allocation. The first flavor assigns a
      label for each unique "RD, EP". The second flavor assigns a label for
      each unique "Transport Class, EP" while ignoring the RD.</t>

      <t>The impacts on control plane and forwarding behavior for the above
      modes are detailed with an example in <xref target="CTRouteVis">Managing
      Transport Route Visibility</xref></t>

    <section title="Comparison with other families using RFC-8277 encoding">
      <t>SAFI 128 (Inet-VPN) is an RFC8277 encoded family that carries service
      prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the customer
      namespaces and are contextualized into separate user virtual service
      RIBs called VRFs using RFC4364 procedures.</t>

      <t>SAFI 4 (BGP LU) is an RFC8277 encoded family that carries transport
      prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the provider
      namespace.</t>

      <t>SAFI 76 (Classful Transport) is an RFC8277 encoded family that
      carries transport prefixes in the NLRI, where the prefixes come from the
      provider namespace and are contextualized into separate Transport Route
      Databases using RFC4364 procedures.</t>

      <t>It is worth noting that SAFI 128 has been used to carry transport
      prefixes in "L3VPN Inter-AS Carrier's carrier" scenario, where BGP
      LU/LDP prefixes in CsC VRF are advertised in SAFI 128 towards the
      remote-end client carrier.</t>

      <t>In this document, a new AFI/SAFI is used instead of reusing SAFI 128
      to carry these transport routes because it is operationally advantageous
      to segregate transport and service prefixes into separate address
      families. E.g. It allows to safely enable "per-prefix" label allocation
      scheme for Classful Transport prefixes without affecting SAFI 128
      service prefixes, which may have huge scale. The "per prefix" label
      allocation scheme keeps the routing churn local during topology
      changes.</t>

      <t>A new family also facilitates having a different readvertisement path
      of the transport family routes in a network than the service route
      readvertisement path. Service routes (Inet-VPN) are exchanged over an
      EBGP multihop session between Autonomous systems with nexthop unchanged;
      whereas Classful Transport routes are readvertised over EBGP single hop
      sessions with "nexthop self" rewrite over inter-AS links.</t>

      <t>The Classful Transport family is similar in vein to BGP LU, in that
      it carries transport prefixes. The only difference is that it also
      carries in Route Target, an indication of which Transport Class the
      transport prefix belongs to and uses RD to disambiguate multiple
      instances of the same transport prefix in a BGP Update.</t>

            <t>The egress node of the tunnel i.e. the tunnel endpoint
            originates the BGP Classful Transport route with NLRI containing
            RD:TunnelEndpoint, Transport Class RT and PNH TunnelEndpoint,
            which will resolve over the tunnel route in Transport Route
            Database at the ingress node. When the tunnel is up, the Classful
            Transport BGP route will become usable and get re-advertised.</t>

            <t>Alternatively, the ingress node may advertise this tunnel
            destination into BGP as a Classful Transport family route with
            NLRI RD:TunnelEndpoint, attaching a 'Transport Class' Route Target
            that identifies the Transport Class. This BGP CT route is
            advertised to EBGP peers and IBGP peers in neighboring domains.
            This route SHOULD NOT be advertised to the IBGP core that contains

          this route maps to. The resolution scheme for a Transport Class RT
          with Transport class ID "C1" contains Transport Route Database for
          Transport Class with same ID. In cases where Transport class "C1"
          tunnels are not available in a domain, the administrator MAY
          customize the Resolution scheme to map to a different set of
          transport class available in that domain.</t>

          <t>The routes in the associated Transport Route Databases are used

      <section title="Border node readvertising Classful Transport route with nexthop self">
        <list>
          <t>The BN allocates an MPLS label to advertise upstream in Classful
          Transport NLRI. The BN also installs an MPLS route for that label
          that swaps the incoming label with a label received from the
          downstream BGP speaker or pops the incoming label. It then pushes
          received traffic to the transport tunnel or direct interface that
          the Classful Transport route's PNH resolved over.</t>

          <t>The label SHOULD be allocated with "per-prefix" label allocation
          semantics. RD is stripped from the BGP CT NLRI prefix when a BGP CT
          route is added to a Transport Route Database. The IP prefix in the
          Transport Route Database context (Transport-Class, IP-prefix) is
          used as the key to do per-prefix label allocation. This helps in
          avoiding BGP CT route churn throughout the CT network when a failure
          happens in a domain. The failure is not propagated further than the
          BN closest to the failure.</t>

          <t>The value of the advertised MPLS label is locally significant,
          and is dynamic by default. The BN may provide an option to allocate
          a value from a statically carved out range. This can be achieved

        <list>
          <t>A pair of redundant ABRs, each acting as an RR with nexthop self,
          may choose each other as best path instead of the upstream ASBR,
          causing a traffic forwarding loop. This happens because of following
          the path selection rule specified in <xref target="RFC4456">BGP
          RR</xref> that tie-breaks on ROUTER-ID before CLUSTER_LIST. RFC4456
          considers pure RR which is not in forwarding path. When RR is in
          forwarding path and reflects routes with nexthop self, as is the
          case for ABR BNs in a BGP transport network, this rule may cause
          loops.</t>

          <t>Implementations SHOULD provide a way to alter the tie-breaking
          rule specified in <xref target="RFC4456">BGP RR</xref> so as to
          tie-break on CLUSTER_LIST step before ROUTER-ID step, when
          performing path selection for BGP CT routes.</t>

          <t>This document suggests the following modification to the BGP
          Decision Process Tie Breaking rules (Sec. 9.1.2.2, <xref
          target="RFC4271"/>) that can be applied to path selection of BGP CT
          family routes:</t>

          <t>The following rule SHOULD be inserted between Steps e) and f): a
          BGP Speaker SHOULD prefer a route with the shorter CLUSTER_LIST
          length. The CLUSTER_LIST length is zero if a route does not carry
          the CLUSTER_LIST attribute.</t>

          <t>Some deployment considerations can also help in avoiding this
          problem: <list>
              <t>IGP metric should be assigned such that "ABR to redundant
              ABR" cost is inferior than "ABR to upstream ASBR" cost.</t>

              <t>Tunnels belonging to non best effort Transport Classes SHOULD
              NOT be provisioned between ABRs. This will ensure that the route
              received from an ABR with nexthop self will not be usable at a
              redundant ABR.</t>

      <section title="Coordinating between domains using different community namespaces">
        <list>
          <t>Cooperating option-C domains may sometimes not agree on RT, RD,
          Mapping community or Transport Route Target values because of
          differences in community namespaces (e.g. during network mergers or
          renumbering for expansion). Such deployments may deploy mechanisms
          to map and rewrite the Route Target values on domain boundaries,
          using per ASBR import policies. This is no different than any other
          BGP VPN family. Mechanisms used in inter-AS VPN deployments may be
          used with the Classful Transport family also.</t>

          <t>The Resolution Schemes SHOULD allow association with multiple

          <t>It is possible to represent 'Best effort' SLA also as a Transport
          class. Today, BGP LU (SAFI 4) is used to extend the best effort
          intra domain tunnels to other domains.</t>

          <t>Alternatively, BGP CT (SAFI 76) may be used to carry the best
          effort tunnels also. This document reserves the Transport class ID
          value 0 to represent "Best Effort Transport Class ID". However,
          implementations SHOULD provide configuration to use a different
          value for this purpose.</t>

          <t>The 'Best Effort Transport Class ID' value is used in the
          'Transport Class ID' field of Transport Route Target extended
          community that is attached to the BGP CT route that advertises a
          best effort tunnel endpoint. The route target thus formed is called
          the "Best Effort Transport class route target".</t>

          <t>When a BN or SN receives a BGP CT route with Best Effort
          Transport class route target as the mapping community, the Best
          effort Resolution scheme is used for resolving the BGP nexthop, and
          the resultant route is installed in the best effort transport route
          database. If no best effort tunnel was found to resolve the BGP
          nexthop, the BGP CT route MUST be considered unusable, and not be
          propagated further.</t>

          <t>When a BGP speaker receives an overlay route without any explicit
          mapping community, the Best effort Resolution scheme is used for
          resolving the BGP nexthop on the route. This behavior is backward
          compatible to behavior of an implementation that does not follow
          procedures described in this document.</t>

          <t>Implementations MAY provide configuration to selectively install
          BGP CT routes to the FIB, to provide reachability for control plane
          peering towards endpoints in other domains.</t>

      <t>The Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute, described in <xref
      target="RFC9012">RFC9012</xref> can be used to request a specific type
      of tunnel encapsulation. Usage of this attribute may apply to BGP

      family routes.</t>

      <t>Mechanisms described in <xref target="MULTI-NH-ATTR">BGP MultiNexthop

      It also allows specifying 'Transport Class ID' as a qualifier for each
      Nexthop address.</t>

      <t>It should be noted that in such cases "Transport Class/Color" can
      exist in multiple places on the same route, and a precedence order needs
      to be established to determine which Transport class the route's nexthop
      should resolve over. This document suggests the following order of
      precedence, more preferred first: <list>
          <t>Transport Class ID SubTLV, in MultiNexthop Attribute.</t>

          <t>Color SubTLV, in Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute.</t>

          <t>Transport Target Extended community, on BGP CT route.</t>

          <t>Color Extended community, on BGP service route.</t>
        </list> The above precedence order follows more specific scoping of
      Color to less specific scoping.</t>

      <t>Transport Class ID specified for Nexthop-Leg subTLV in a MultiNextHop
      attribute is more specific indication of Color than Color subTLV in a
      TEA, which in turn is more specific than Mapping Community (Transport
      Target) on a BGP CT transport route, which is in turn more specific than
      a Service route scoped Mapping Community (Color Extended community).</t>

        <t>Let PE1 be configured to map DSCP1 to Gold Transport class, and
        DSCP2 to Bronze Transport class. Based on the DSCP code point received
        on the IP traffic from CE1, the PE1 forwards the IP packet over a Gold
        or Bronze tunnel. Thus, the forwarding is not based on just the
        destination IP address, but also the DSCP code point. This is known as
        Class Based Forwarding (CBF). Today CBF is configured at the PE1
        devices and CE1 doesn't receive any indication in BGP signaling
        regarding what DSCP code points are being offered by the provider
        network.</t>

        <t>With a <xref target="MULTI-NH-ATTR">BGP MultiNexthop

        extend the PE-CE BGP signalling to communicate such information to the

        described by two Forwarding Instruction TLVs. Each Nexthop Leg
        contains the PE1 nexthop address in Endpoint Identifier TLV (<xref

        target="MULTI-NH-ATTR"/> Sec 5.4.3.4.) to the CE1 device. This allows
        the CE to discover what transport classes exist in the provider

      <section title="Using MPLS Label in MultiNexthop attribute">
        <t>If the PE-CE link is MPLS enabled, a distinct MPLS label can also
        be used to identify the transport class. PE1 can allocate a MPLS Label
        L1 for the tuple "VPN Label, PNH Address, Transport class ID" and
        advertise to CE1. When MPLS packet with label L1 is received from CE1,
        the label is Popped, VPN Label if any is pushed, and then push tunnel
        encap information related to "PNH address, Transport class ID". PE1
        may thus do forwarding based on MPLS label without performing any IP
        lookup. This allows for PE1 to be a low IP FIB device and still
        support CBF. The number of MPLS Labels will be proportional to the
        number of unique VPN labels received.</t>

        <t>A <xref target="MULTI-NH-ATTR">BGP MultiNexthop Attribute</xref> is
        attached to a SAFI 1 service route to convey the MPLS Label
        information to CE1. In the above example, the MNH contains two Nexthop
        Legs, described by two Forwarding Instruction TLVs. Each Nexthop Leg
        contains the PE1 nexthop address in Endpoint Identifier TLV (<xref

        (<xref target="MULTI-NH-ATTR"/> Sec 5.5.2.2.) for Gold, Bronze

        <t>The MPLS enabled PE-CE link is considered connecting to an
        untrusted domain. Such interfaces can be secured against MPLS label
        spoofing by confining the interface to a specific MPLS context table
        corresponding to the BGP peer. Such that only the route for labels
        advertised to CE1 are installed in the MPLS context table
        corresponding to the CE1 peer. This ensures that if CE1 sends MPLS
        packet with a label that was not advertised to the CE1, the packet
        will be dropped.</t>

          Policies in order to receive or send routes over EBGP sessions.</t>

          <t>It is recommended to follow this for BGP CT routes. It will
          prohibit unintended advertisement of transport routes throughout the
          BGP CT transport domain, which may span across multiple AS domains.
          This will conserve usage of MPLS label and nexthop resources in the
          network. An ASBR of a domain can be provisioned to allow routes with
          only the Transport Route Targets that are required by SNs in the
          domain.</t>

      <section title="Constrained distribution of PNHs to SNs (On Demand Nexthop)">
        <list>
          <t>This section describes how the number of Protocol Nexthops
          advertised to a SN or BN can be constrained using BGP Classful
          Transport and <xref target="RFC4684">Route Target Constraints
          (RTC)</xref>.</t>

          <t>An egress SN MAY advertise BGP CT route for RD:eSN with two Route
          Targets: transport-target:0:&lt;TC&gt; and a RT carrying
          &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt;. Where TC is the Transport Class identifier,
          and eSN is the IP-address used by SN as BGP nexthop in its service
          route advertisements.</t>

          <t>Note that such use of the IP address specific route target
          &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt; is optional in a BGP CT network. It is
          required only if there is a requirement to prune the propagation of
          the transport route for an egress node eSN to only the set of
          ingress nodes that need it. When only RT of
          transport-target:0:&lt;TC&gt; is used, the pruning happens in
          granularity of Transport Class ID (Color), and not BGP nexthop; BGP
          CT routes will not be advertised into domains with PEs that don't
          import its transport class.</t>

          <t>The transport-target:0:&lt;TC&gt; is the new type of route target
          (Transport Class RT) defined in this document. It is carried in BGP
          extended community attribute (BGP attribute code 16).</t>

          <t>The RT carrying &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt; MAY be an IP-address
          specific regular RT (BGP attribute code 16), IPv6-address specific
          RT (BGP attribute code 25), or a Wide-communities based RT (BGP
          attribute code 34) as described in <xref target="RTC-Ext">Route
          Target Constrain Extension</xref>. This document recommends using
          Wide-communities based RT for the same.</t>

          <t>An ingress SN MAY import BGP CT routes with Route Target carrying
          &lt;eSN&gt;:&lt;TC&gt;. The ingress SN MAY learn the eSN values
          either by configuration, or it MAY discover them from the BGP
          nexthop field in the BGP VPN service routes received from eSN. A BGP
          ingress SN receiving a BGP service route with nexthop of eSN SHOULD
          generate a RTC/Extended-RTC route for Route Target prefix &lt;Origin
          ASN&gt;:&lt;eSN&gt;/[80|176] in order to learn BGP CT transport
          routes to reach eSN. This allows constrained distribution of the
          transport routes to the PNHs actually required by iSN.</t>

          <t>When the path of route propagation of BGP CT routes is same as
          the RTC routes, a BN would learn the RTC routes advertised by
          ingress SNs and propagate further. This will allow constraining
          distribution of BGP CT routes for a PNH to only the necessary BNs in
          the network, closer to the egress SN.</t>

          <t>This mechanism provides "On Demand Nexthop" of BGP CT routes,
          which help with the scaling of MPLS forwarding state at SN and
          BN.</t>

          <t>However, the amount of state carried in RTC family may become
          proportional to the number of PNHs in the network. To strike a
          balance, the RTC route advertisements for &lt;Origin
          ASN&gt;:&lt;eSN&gt;/[80|176] MAY be confined to the BNs in home
          region of ingress-SN, or the BNs of a super core.</t>

          <t>Such a BN in the core of the network SHOULD import BGP CT routes
          with Transport-Target:0:&lt;TC&gt; and generate a RTC route for
          &lt;Origin ASN&gt;:0:&lt;TC&gt;/96, while not propagating the more
          specific RTC requests for specific PNHs. This will let the BN learn
          transport routes to all eSN nodes. But confine their propagation to
          ingress-SNs.</t>

      <section title="Limiting scope of visibility of PE loopback as PNHs">
        <list>
          <t>It may be even more desirable to limit the number of PNHs that
          are globally visible in the network. This is possible using
          mechanism described in <xref target="MPLS-NAMESPACES">MPLS
          Namespaces</xref></t>

          <t>Such that advertisement of PE loopback addresses as next-hop in
          BGP service routes is confined to the region they belong to. An
          anycast IP-address called "Context Protocol Nexthop Address" (CPNH)
          abstracts the SNs in a region from other regions in the network,
          swapping the SN scoped service label with a CPNH scoped private
          namespace label.</t>

          <t>This provides much greater advantage in terms of scaling and
          convergence. Changes to implement this feature are required only on
          the local region's BNs and RRs.</t>

        </figure>

        <t>This example shows a provider network that consists of two
        Autonomous systems, AS1, AS2. They are serving customers AS3, AS4
        respectively. Traffic direction being described is CE41 to CE31. CE31
        may request a specific SLA (e.g. Gold for this traffic), when
        traversing these provider networks.</t>

        <t>AS2 is further divided into two regions. So, there are three tunnel
        domains in provider space. AS1 uses ISIS Flex-Algo intra-domain
        tunnels, whereas AS2 uses RSVP-TE intra-domain tunnels.</t>

        <t>The network has two Transport classes: Gold with transport class id
        100, Bronze with transport class id 200. These transport classes are
        provisioned at the PEs and the Border nodes (ABRs, ASBRs) in the
        network.</t>

        <t>Following tunnels exist for Gold transport class.<list>
            <t>PE25_to_ABR23_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel</t>

            <t>PE25_to_ABR24_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel</t>

            <t>ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold - RSVP-TE tunnel</t>

        <t>Service nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate service families (SAFIs 1, 128)
        on the BGP session with RR16. Service helpers RR16 and RR26 exchange
        these service routes with nexthop unchanged over a multihop EBGP
        session between the two AS. PE25 negotiates service families (SAFIs 1,
        128) with RR26.</t>

        <t>The PEs see each other as nexthop in the BGP Update for service
        family (SAFIs 1, 128) routes. Addpath send, receive is enabled on both
        directions on the EBGP multihop session between RR16 and RR26 for
        SAFIs 1, 128. Addpath send is negotiated in the RR to PE direction in
        each AS. This is to avoid path hiding of service routes at RR. E.g.
        SAFI 1 routes advertised by both PE11 and PE12. Or, SAFI 128 routes
        originated by both PE11 and PE12 using same RD.</t>

        <t>Forwarding happens using service routes installed at service nodes
        PE25, PE11, PE12 only. Service routes received from CEs are not
        present in any other nodes' FIB in the network.</t>

        <t>As an example, CE31 advertises a route for prefix 31.31.31.31 with
        nexthop as self to PE11, PE12. CE31 can attach a Mapping Community
        Color:0:100 on this route, to indicate its request for Gold SLA. Or,
        PE11 can attach the same using locally configured policies.</t>

        <t>Consider, CE31 is getting VPN service from PE11. The
        RD1:31.31.31.31 route is readvertised in SAFI 128 by PE11 with nexthop
        self (1.1.1.1) and label V-L1, to RR16 with the Mapping Community
        Color:0:100 attached. RR16 advertises this route with Addpath-ID to
        RR26 which readvertises to PE25 with nexthop unchanged. Now, PE25 can
        resolve the PNH 1.1.1.1 using transport routes received in BGP CT or
        BGP LU.</t>

        <t>Using Addpath, service routes advertised by PE11 and PE12 for SAFIs
        1, 128 reach PE25 via RR16, RR26 with the nexthop unchanged, as PE11
        or PE12.</t>

        <t>The IP FIB at PE25 VRF will have a route for 31.31.31.31 with a
        nexthop when resolved, that points to a Gold tunnel in ingress
        domain.</t>

      <section title="Transport Layer route propagation">
        <t>Egress nodes PE11, PE12 negotiate BGP CT family with transport
        ASBRs ASBR13, ASBR14. These egress nodes originate BGP CT routes for
        tunnel endpoint addresses, that are advertised as nexthop in BGP
        service routes. In this example, both PEs participate in transport
        classes Gold and Bronze. The protocol procedures are explained using
        Gold SLA plane and the Bronze SLA plane is used to highlight the path
        hiding aspects.</t>

        <t>PE11 is provisioned with transport class 100, RD value 1.1.1.1:10
        and a transport-target:0:100 for Gold tunnels. And a Transport class
        200 with RD value 1.1.1.1:20, and transport route target 0:200 for
        Bronze tunnels. Similarly, PE12 is provisioned with transport class
        100, RD value 1.1.1.2:10 and a transport-target:0:100 for Gold
        tunnels. And transport class 200, RD value 1.1.1.2:20 with
        transport-target:0:200 for Bronze tunnels. Note that in this example,
        the BGP CT routes carry only the transport class route target, and no
        IP address format route target.</t>

        <t>The RD value originated by an egress node is not modified by any
        BGP speakers when the route is readvertised to the ingress node. Thus,
        the RD can be used to identify the originator (unique RD provisioned)
        or set of originators (RD reused on multiple nodes).</t>

        <t>Similarly, these transport classes are also configured on ASBRs,
        ABRs and PEs with same Transport Route Target and unique RDs.</t>

        <t>ASBR13 and ASBR14 negotiate BGP CT family with transport ASBRs
        ASBR21, ASBR22 in neighboring AS. They negotiate BGP CT family with
        RR27 in region 2, which reflects BGP CT routes to ABR23, ABR24. ABR23,
        ABR24 negotiate BGP CT family with Ingress node PE25 in region 1. BGP
        LU family is also negotiated on these sessions alongside BGP CT
        family. BGP LU carries "best effort" transport class routes, BGP CT
        carries gold, bronze transport class routes.</t>

        <t>PE11 is provisioned to originate BGP CT route with Gold SLA to
        endpoint PE11. This route is sent with NLRI RD prefix
        1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1, Label B-L0, nexthop 1.1.1.1 and a route target
        extended community transport-target:0:100. Label B-L0 can either be
        Implicit Null (Label 3) or an Ultimate Hop Pop (UHP) label.</t>

        <t>This route is received by ASBR13 and it resolves over the tunnel
        ASBR13_to_PE11_gold. The route is then readvertised by ASBR13 in BGP
        CT family to ASBRs ASBR21, ASBR22 according to export policy. This
        route is sent with same NLRI RD prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1, Label B-L1,
        nexthop self, and transport-target:0:100. MPLS swap route is installed
        at ASBR13 for B-L1 with a nexthop pointing to ASBR13_to_PE11_gold
        tunnel.</t>

        <t>Similarly, ASBR14 also receives BGP CT route for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1
        from PE11 and it resolves over the tunnel ASBR14_to_PE11_gold. The
        route is then readvertised by ASBR14 in BGP CT family to ASBRs ASBR21,
        ASBR22 according to export policy. This route is sent with same NLRI
        RD prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1, Label B-L2, nexthop self, and
        transport-target:0:100. MPLS swap route is installed at ASBR14 for
        B-L1 with a nexthop pointing to ASBR14_to_PE11_gold tunnel.</t>

        <t>In the Bronze plane, BGP CT route with Bronze SLA to endpoint PE11
        is originated by PE11 with a NLRI containing RD prefix
        1.1.1.1:20:1.1.1.1, and appropriate label. The RD allows both Gold and
        Bronze advertisements traverse path selection pinchpoints without any
        path hiding at RRs or ASBRs. And route target extended community
        transport-target:0:200 lets the route resolve over Bronze tunnels in
        the network, similar to the process being described for Gold SLA
        path.</t>

        <t>Moving back to the Gold plane, ASBR21 receives the Gold SLA BGP CT
        routes for NLRI RD prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 over the single hop EBGP
        sessions from ASBR13, ASBR14, and can compute ECMP/FRR towards them.
        ASBR21 readvertises BGP CT route for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 with nexthop
        self (loopback address 2.2.2.1) to RR27, advertising a new label B-L3.
        MPLS swap route is installed for label B-L3 at ASBR21 to swap to
        received label B-L1, B-L2 and forward to ASBR13, ASBR14 respectively.
        RR27 readvertises this BGP CT route to ABR23, ABR24 with label and
        nexthop unchanged.</t>

        <t>Similarly, ASBR22 receives BGP CT route 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 over the
        single hop EBGP sessions from ASBR13, ASBR14, and readvertises with
        nexthop self (loopback address 2.2.2.2) to RR27, advertising a new
        label B-L4. MPLS swap route is installed for label B-L4 at ASBR22 to
        swap to received label B-L1, B-L2 and forward to ASBR13, ASBR14
        respectively. RR27 readvertises this BGP CT route also to ABR23, ABR24
        with label and nexthop unchanged.</t>

        <t>Addpath is enabled for BGP CT family on the sessions between RR27
        and ASBRs, ABRs such that routes for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 with the
        nexthops ASBR21 and ASBR22 are reflected to ABR23, ABR24 without any
        path hiding. Thus giving ABR23 visibility of both available nexthops
        for Gold SLA.</t>

        <t>ABR23 receives the route with nexthop 2.2.2.1, label B-L3 from
        RR27. The route target "transport-target:0:100" on this route acts as
        Mapping Community, and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve the nexthop
        using transport class 100 routes only. ABR23 is unable to find a route
        for 2.2.2.1 with transport class 100. Thus, it considers this route
        unusable and does not propagate it further. This prunes ASBR21 from
        Gold SLA tunneled path.</t>

        <t>ABR23 also receives the route with nexthop 2.2.2.2, label B-L4 from
        RR27. The route target "transport-target:0:100" on this route acts as
        Mapping Community, and instructs ABR23 to strictly resolve the nexthop
        using transport class 100 routes only. ABR23 successfully resolves the
        nexthop to point to ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel. ABR23 readvertises
        this BGP CT route with nexthop self (loopback address 2.2.2.3) and a
        new label B-L5 to PE25. Swap route for B-L5 is installed by ABR23 to
        swap to label B-L4, and forward into ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel.</t>

        <t>PE25 receives the BGP CT route for prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 with
        label B-L5, nexthop 2.2.2.3 and transport-target:0:100 from RR26. And
        it similarly resolves the nexthop 2.2.2.3 over transport class 100,
        pushing labels associated with PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.</t>

        <t>In this manner, the Gold transport LSP "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" in
        egress-domain is extended by BGP CT until the ingress-node PE25 in
        ingress domain, to create an end-to-end Gold SLA path. MPLS swap
        routes are installed at ASBR13, ASBR22 and ABR23, when propagating the
        PE11 BGP CT Gold transport class route 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 with nexthop
        self towards PE25.</t>

        <t>The BGP CT LSP thus formed, originates in PE25, and terminates in
        ASBR13 (assuming PE11 advertised Implicit Null), traversing over the
        Gold underlay LSPs in each domain. ASBR13 uses UHP to stitch the BGP
        CT LSP into the "ASBR13_to_PE11_gold" LSP to traverse the last domain,
        thus satisfying Gold SLA end-to-end.</t>

        <t>When PE25 receives service routes from RR26 with nexthop 1.1.1.1
        and mapping community Color:0:100, it resolves over this BGP CT route
        1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1. Thus pushing label B-L5, and pushing as top label
        the labels associated with PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel.</t>

      <section title="Data plane view">
        <section title="Steady state">
          <t>This section describes how the data plane looks like in steady
          state.</t>

          <t>CE41 transmits an IP packet with destination as 31.31.31.31. On
          receiving this packet, PE25 performs a lookup in the IP FIB
          associated with the CE41 interface. This lookup yields the service
          route that pushes the VPN service label V-L1, BGP CT label B-L5, and
          labels for PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel. Thus, PE25 encapsulates the IP
          packet in MPLS packet with label V-L1(innermost), B-L5, and top
          label as PE25_to_ABR23_gold tunnel. This MPLS packet is thus
          transmitted to ABR23 using Gold SLA.</t>

          <t>ABR23 decapsulates the packet received on PE25_to_ABR23_gold
          tunnel as required, and finds the MPLS packet with label B-L5. It
          performs lookup for label B-L5 in the global MPLS FIB. This yields
          the route that swaps label B-L5 with label B-L4, and pushes the top
          label provided by ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold tunnel. Thus, ABR23 transmits
          the MPLS packet with label B-L4 to ASBR22, on a tunnel that
          satisfies Gold SLA.</t>

          <t>ASBR22 similarly performs a lookup for label B-L4 in global MPLS
          FIB, finds the route that swaps label B-L4 with label B-L2, and
          forwards to ASBR13 over the directly connected MPLS enabled
          interface. This interface is a common resource not dedicated to any
          specific transport class, in this example.</t>

          <t>ASBR13 receives the MPLS packet with label B-L2, and performs a
          lookup in MPLS FIB, finds the route that pops label B-L2, and pushes
          labels associated with ASBR13_to_PE11_gold tunnel. This transmits
          the MPLS packet with VPN label V-L1 to PE11 using a tunnel that
          preserves Gold SLA in AS 1.</t>

          <t>PE11 receives the MPLS packet with V-L1, and performs VPN
          forwarding. Thus transmitting the original IP payload from CE41 to
          CE31. The payload has traversed path satisfying Gold SLA
          end-to-end.</t>

        <section title="Local repair of primary path">
          <t>This section describes how the data plane at ASBR22 reacts when
          the link between ASBR22 and ASBR13 experiences a failure, and an
          alternate path exists.</t>

          <t>Assuming ASBR22_to_ASBR13 link goes down, such that traffic with
          Gold SLA going to PE11 needs repair. ASBR22 has an alternate BGP CT
          route for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 from ASBR14. This has been
          preprogrammed in forwarding by ASBR22 as FRR backup nexthop for
          label B-L4. This allows the Gold SLA traffic to be locally repaired
          at ASBR22 without the failure event propagated in the BGP CT
          network. In this case, ingress node PE25 will not know there was a
          failure, and traffic restoration will be independent of prefix scale
          (PIC).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Absorbing failure of primary path. Fallback to best-effort tunnels.">
          <t>This section describes how the data plane reacts when gold path
          experiences a failure, but no alternate path exists.</t>

          <t>Assuming tunnel ABR23_to_ASBR22_gold goes down, such that now
          end-to-end Gold path does not exist in the network. This makes the
          BGP CT route for RD prefix 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 unusable at ABR23.
          This makes ABR23 send a BGP withdrawal for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 to
          PE25.</t>

          <t>Withdrawal for 1.1.1.1:10:1.1.1.1 allows PE25 to react to the
          loss of gold path to 1.1.1.1. Assuming PE25 is provisioned to use
          best-effort transport class as the backup path, this withdrawal of
          BGP CT route allows PE25 to adjust the nexthop of the VPN
          Service-route to push the labels provided by the BGP LU route. That
          repairs the traffic to go via best effort path. PE25 can also be
          provisioned to use Bronze transport class as the backup path. The
          repair will happen in similar manner in that case as-well.</t>

          <t>Traffic repair to absorb the failure happens at ingress node
          PE25, in a service prefix scale independent manner. This is called
          PIC (Prefix scale Independent Convergence). The repair time will be
          proportional to time taken for withdrawing the BGP CT route.</t>

          <t>The above examples demonstrate the various levels of failsafe
          mechanisms available to protect traffic in a BGP CT network.</t>

    <section title="Deployment considerations.">
      <section title="Managing Intent at Service and Transport layers.">
        <t><xref target="CTProc">Illustration of BGP CT Procedures </xref>
        shows multiple domains that agree on a color name space (Agreeing
        Color Domains) and contain tunnels with equivalent set of colors
        (Homogenous Color Domains).</t>

        <t>However in the real world, this may not always be guaranteed. Two
        domains may independently manage their color namespaces, these are
        known as Non-Agreeing Color Domains. Two domains may have tunnels with
        unequal set of colors, these are known as Heterogeneous Color
        Domains.</t>

        <t>This section describes how BGP CT is deployed in such scenarios to
        preserve end to end Intent. Example described in this section use
        Inter AS option C domains. But similar mechanisms will work for Inter
        AS option A and Inter AS option B scenarios as-well.</t>

        <section title="Service layer Color Management ">
          <t>At the service layer, it is recommended that a global color
          namespace be maintained across multiple co-operating domains. BGP CT
          allows indirection using resolution schemes to be able to maintain a
          global namespace in the service layer. This is possible even if each
          domain independently maintains its own local transport color
          namespace.</t>

          <t>As explained in <xref target="Nexthop_Resoln_Schm">Nexthop
          Resolution Scheme</xref> , mapping community carried on service
          route maps to a resolution scheme. The mapping community values for
          the service route can be abstract and does not require to match the
          transport color namespace. This abstract mapping community value
          representing a global service layer intent is mapped to a local
          transport layer intent available in each domain.</t>

          <t>In this manner, it is recommended to keep color namespace
          management at the service layer and the transport layer decoupled
          from each other. In the following sections the service layer agrees
          on a single global namespace.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Non-Agreeing Color Transport Domains">
          <t>Non-agreeing color domains require a mapping community rewrite on
          each domain boundary. This rewrite helps to map one domain's
          namespace to another.</t>

          <t>The below example illustrates how traffic is stitched and SLA is

          <t>In the above topology, we have three Autonomous Systems. All the
          nodes in the topology supports BGP CT.</t>

          <t>In AS1 Gold SLA is represented by color 100 and Bronze by
          200.</t>

          <t>In AS2 Gold SLA is represented by color 300 and Bronze by

          <t>In AS3 Gold SLA is represented by color 500 and Bronze by
          600.</t>

          <t>Though the color values are different, they map to tunnels with
          sufficiently similar TE characteristics in each domain.</t>

          <t>The service route carries an abstract mapping community that maps
          to the required SLA. For example, Service routes that need to
          resolve over gold transport tunnels, carries a mapping community
          color:0:100500. In AS3 it maps to a resolution scheme containing
          TRDB with color 500 whereas in AS2 it maps to a TRDB with color 300
          and in AS1 it maps to a TRDB with color 100. Co-ordination is needed
          to provision the resolution schemes in each domain as explained
          above.</t>

          <t>At the AS boundary, the transport-class route-target is rewritten
          for the BGP CT routes. In the above topology, At ASBR31 the
          transport-target:0:500 for gold tunnels is rewritten to
          transport-target:0:300 and then advertised to ASBR22. Similarly, the
          transport-target:0:300 for gold tunnels are re-written to
          transport-target:0:100 at ASBR21 before advertising to ASBR11. At
          PE11, the transport route received with transport-target:0:100 will
          be added to the color 100 TRDB. The service route received with
          mapping community color:0:100500 at PE1 maps to the gold TRDB and
          resolves over this transport route.</t>

          <t>Inter-domain traffic forwarding in the above topology works as
          explained in <xref target="CTProc"/>.</t>

          <t>Transport-target re-write requires co-ordination of color values
          between domains in the transport layer. This method avoids the need
          to re-write service route mapping community, keeping the service
          layer homogenous and simple to manage. Co-ordinating transport-class
          route-target between adjacent domains is easier than co-ordinating
          service layer colors deployed in various non-adjacent domains.</t>

        <section title="Heterogeneous Agreeing Color Transport Domains">
          <t>In a heterogeneous domains scenario, it might not be possible to
          map a service layer intent to the matching transport color, as the
          color might not be locally available in a domain.</t>

          <t>In this model, resolution schemes are customized to map the
          received mapping community (eg: transport-target or color community)
          to locally available TRDBs that are acceptable to realize the
          desired intent.</t>

          <t>The below example illustrates how traffic is stitched, when a
          transit AS contains more shades for an SLA paths compared to Ingress
          and Egress domains. This example shows how service routes can
          traverse through finer shades when available and take coarse shades
          otherwise.</t>

          <t>Service routes advertised by PE31 that need to resolve over Gold1

          using a customized resolution scheme. In AS2, Gold1 is available and
          it maps to color 101 TRDB.</t>

          <t>To facilitate this mapping, every SN/BN in all AS provision
          required transport classes viz. 100, 101 and 102. SN and BN in AS1
          and AS3 are provisioned with customized resolution schemes that
          resolve routes with transport-target:0:101 or transport-target:0:102
          strictly over color 100 TRDB.</t>

          <t>PE31 is provisioned to originate BGP CT route with color 101 for
          endpoint PE31. This route is sent with NLRI RD prefix RD1:PE31 and

          <t>At ASBR31, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP
          CT route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB. ASBR31 is
          provisioned with customized resolution scheme that resolves the
          routes carrying mapping community transport-target:0:101 to resolve
          using color 100 TRDB. This route is then re-advertised from color
          101 TRDB to ASBR22 with route-target:0:101.</t>

          <t>At ASBR22, the BGP CT routes received with transport-target:0:101
          will be added to color 101 TRDB and strictly resolve over tunnel
          routes in the same TRDB. This route is re-advertised to ASBR21 with
          transport-target:0:101.</t>

          <t>Similarly, at ASBR21, the BGP CT routes received with
          transport-target:0:101 will be added to color 101 TRDB and strictly
          resolve over tunnel routes in the same TRDB. This route is
          re-advertised to ASBR11 with transport-target:0:101.</t>

          <t>At ASBR11, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP
          CT route instructs to add the route to color 101 TRDB. ASBR11 is
          provisioned with a customized resolution scheme that resolves the
          routes carrying transport-target:0:101 to use color 100 TRDB. This
          route is then re-advertised from color 101 TRDB to PE11 with

          <t>At PE11, the route target "transport-target:0:101" on this BGP CT

          <t>When PE11 receives the service route with the mapping community
          color:0:101 it directly resolves over the BGP CT route in color 101
          TRDB, which in turn resolves over tunnel routes in color 100
          TRDB.</t>

          <t>In this manner, PE11 can put traffic on tunnels with color 101,

          <t>RD:PE11 BGP CT route is originated from PE11 towards ASBR11 with
          transport-target gold. ASBR11 readvertises this route with nexthop
          set to ASBR11_lpbk_gold on the EBGP multihop session towards ASBR31.
          ASBR11 originates BGP LU route for endpoint ASBR11_lpbk_gold on EBGP
          session to ASBR21 with a 'gold SLA' community, and BGP LU route for
          ASBR11_lpbk_bronze with a 'bronze SLA' community. The SLA community
          is used by ASBR31 to publish the BGP LU routes in the corresponding
          BGP CT TRDBs.</t>

          <t>ASBR21 readvertises the BGP LU route for endpoint
          ASBR11_lpbk_gold to ASBR22 with nexthop set by local policy config
          to the unique loopback ASBR21_lpbk_gold by matching the 'gold SLA'
          community received as part BGP LU advertisement from ASBR11. ASBR22
          receives this route and resolves the nexthop over the
          ASBR22_to_ASBR21_lpbk_gold RSVP-TE tunnel. On successful resolution,
          ASBR22 readvertises this BGP LU route to ASBR31 with nexthop self
          and a new label.</t>

          <t>ASBR31 adds the ASBR11_lpbk_gold route received via EBGP LU from
          ASBR22 to gold TRDB based on the received 'gold SLA' community.
          ASBR31 uses this gold TRDB route to resolve the nexthop
          ASBR11_lpbk_gold received on BGP CT route with transport-target
          gold, for the prefix RD:PE11 received over the EBGP multihop CT
          session, thus preserving the end-to-end SLA. Now ASBR31 readvertises
          the BGP CT route for RD:PE11 with nexthop as self thus stitching
          with the BGP LU LSP in AS2. Intradomain traffic forwarding in AS1
          and AS3 follows the procedures as explained in <xref
          target="CTProc">Illustration of CT Procedures</xref></t>

          <t>In cases where an SLA cannot be preserved in AS2 because SLA
          specific tunnels and loopbacks dont exist in AS2, traffic can be
          carried over available SLAs (eg: best-effort SLA) by rewriting the
          nexthop to ASBR21 loopback assigned to the available SLA. This eases
          migration in case of heterogeneous color domains as-well.</t>

            <t>In this example, R1 and R2 support forwarding both MPLS and UDP
            tunneled packets. R3 supports forwarding MPLS packets only. R4
            supports forwarding UDP tunneled packets only. All these nodes
            have BGP session with Route Reflector RR1 which reflects routes
            between these nodes with nexthop unchanged. BGP CT family is
            negotiated on these sessions.</t>

            <t>R1 and R2 send and receive both MPLS label and UDP tunneling
            info in the BGP CT control plane routes. This allows them to be
            ingress and egress for both MPLS and UDP tunneling data planes.
            MPLS label is carried using RFC 8277 encoding. As specified in
            <xref target="RFC9012">RFC 9012</xref>, UDP tunneling information
            is carried using TEA attribute (code 23) or the "barebones" Tunnel
            TLV carried in Encapsulation Extended Community. Either MPLS or
            UDP tunneled forwarding can be used between R1 and R2.</t>

            <t>R1 and R3 send and receive MPLS label in the BGP CT control
            plane routes using RFC 8277 encoding. This allows them to be
            ingress and egress for MPLS data plane. R1 will carry UDP
            tunneling info in TEA attribute, which will not be used by R3.
            MPLS forwarding will be used between R1 and R3.</t>

            <t>R1 and R4 send and receive UDP tunneling info in the BGP CT
            control plane routes using BGP TEA attribute. This allows them to
            be ingress and egress for UDP tunneled data plane. R4 will carry
            special MPLS Label with value 3 (Implicit-NULL) in RFC 8277
            encoding, which tells R1 not to push any MPLS label towards R4.
            The MPLS Label advertised by R1 will not be used by R4. UDP
            tunneled forwarding will be used between R1 and R4.</t>

            <t>Note in this example that R3 and R4 cannot communicate directly
            with each other, because they don't support a common forwarding
            technology. The BGP CT routes received at R3, R4 from each other
            will remain unusable, due to incompatible forwarding
            technology.</t>

        <t>In the above example, both route churn and TE granularity are
        directly proportional to the number of CT labels received.</t>

        <t>The above table demonstrates that BGP CT allows an operator to
        control how much path visibility and forwarding diversity is desired
        in the network, for Unicast and Anycast endpoints.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Mechanisms described in this document carry Transport routes in a new
      BGP address family. That minimizes the possibility of these routes
      leaking outside the expected domain or mixing with service routes.</t>

      <t>When redistributing between SAFI 4 and SAFI 76 Classful Transport
      routes, there is a possibility of SAFI 4 routes mixing with SAFI 1
      service routes. To avoid such scenarios, it is RECOMMENDED that
      implementations support keeping SAFI 4 routes in a separate transport
      RIB, distinct from service RIB that contain SAFI 1 service routes.</t>

      <t>In scenarios where MPLS is enabled towards untrusted domains, e.g. a
      CE-PE link or ASBR-ASBR inter-AS link, security can be provided against
      MPLS label spoofing by confining the interface to a specific MPLS
      context table. Such that MPLS routes for only the labels advertised to
      the BGP peer are added to the MPLS context table associated with the BGP
      peer. This walled garden approach ascertains that if the device in the
      untrusted domain sends MPLS packet with a label that was not advertised
      to the CE, the packet will be dropped. Only MPLS traffic with labels
      advertised to the BGP speaker will be allowed to forward.</t>

      <t>As described in <xref target="RFC4364">BGP VPN</xref> Section 10, in
      an option-C network, service routes (VPN-IPv4) are neither maintained
      nor distributed by the ASBRs. Transport routes are maintained in the
      ASBRs and propagated in BGP LU (SAFI 4) or BGP CT (SAFI 76).</t>

      <t><xref target="CTProc">Illustration of CT Procedures</xref>
      illustrates how constructs of BGP CT work in an Inter AS option-C
      deployment. The BGP CT constructs: SAFI 76, Transport Class and
      Resolution Scheme are used in an option-C deployment.</t>

      <t>In Intra AS and Inter AS option-A, option-B scenarios, SAFI 76 may
      not be used, but the Transport Class and Resolution Scheme mechanisms
      are used to provide service mapping.</t>

      <t>This section illustrates how BGP CT constructs work in Intra AS and
      Inter AS option-A, B deployment scenarios.</t>

          via RR23 with the nexthop unchanged as PE22 and label V-L1. Now
          ASBR21 can resolve the PNH 10.22.22.22 using ASBR21_to_PE22_gold
          SRTE LSP.</t>

          <t>Next, ASBR21 readvertises the RD:10.41.41.41 route with nexthop
          self to ASBR12, with a newly allocated MPLS label, V-L2. Forwarding
          for this label is installed to Swap V-L1, and Push labels for
          ASBR21_to_PE22_gold tunnel.</t>

          <t>ASBR12 further readvertises the RD:10.41.41.41 route via RR13 to
          PE11 with nexthop self 10.12.12.12. PE1 resolves the nexthop
          10.12.12.12 over PE11_to_ASBR11_gold RSVP TE tunnel.</t>

          <t>Traffic traverses as IP packet on the following legs: CE31-PE11,
          PE21-CE41. And uses MPLS forwarding on ASBR11-ASBR21 link, and
          inside AS1, AS2 core.</t>

          <t>BGP CT SAFI 76 is not used in this Inter AS option-B deployment.
          But the Transport class and Resolution Scheme constructs are used to
          preserve end-to-end SLA.</t>

    <section anchor="Appendix B" numbered="true"
             title="Why reuse RFC 8277 and RFC 4364?">
      <t>RFC 4364 is one of the key design patterns produced by networking
      industry. It introduced virtualization and allowed sharing of resources
      in service provider space with multiple tenant networks, providing
      isolated and secure Layer3 VPN services. This design pattern has been
      reused since to provide other service layer virtualizations like Layer2
      virtualization (VPLS, L2VPN, EVPN), ISO virtualization, ATM
      virtualization, Flowspec VPN.</t>

      <t>It is to be noted that these services have different NLRI encoding.
      L3VPN Service family that binds MPLS label to an IP prefix use RFC 8277
      encoding, and others define different NLRI encodings.</t>

      <t>BGP CT reuses RFC 4364 procedures to slice a transport network into
      multiple transport planes that different service routes can bind to,
      using color.</t>

      <t>BGP CT reuses RFC 8277 because it precisely fits the purpose. viz. In
      a MPLS network, BGP CT needs to bind MPLS label for transport endpoints
      which are IPv4 or IPv6 endpoints, and disambiguate between multiple
      instances of those endpoints in multiple transport planes. Hence, use of
      RD:IP_Prefix and carrying a Label for it as specified in RFC 8277 works
      well for this purpose.</t>

      <t>Another advantage of using the precise encoding as defined in RFC
      4364 and RFC 8277 is that it allows to interoperate with BGP speakers
      that support SAFI 128. This can be useful during transition, until all
      BGP speakers in the network support BGP CT.</t>

      <t>In future, if RFC 8277 evolves into a typed NLRI, that does not carry
      Label in the NLRI, BGP CT will be compatible with that as-well. In
      essence, BGP CT encoding is compatible with existing deployed
      technologies (RFC 4364, RFC 8277) and will adapt to any changes RFC 8277
      mechanisms undergo in future.</t>

      <t>This is a more pragmatic approach which leverages the benefits of
      time tested design patterns proposed in RFC 4364 and RFC 8277. Moreover,
      this approach greatly reduces operational training costs and protocol
      compatibility considerations, as it complements and works well with
      existing protocol machineries. This problem does not need reinventing
      the wheel with brand new NLRI and procedures.</t>

      <t>This is a more pragmatic approach, rather than abandoning time tested
      design pattern like RFC 4364 and RFC 8277, just to invent something
      completely new that is not backward compatible with existing
      deployments. Overloading RFC 8277 NLRI MPLS Label field with information
      related to non MPLS data plane leads to backward compatibility
      issues.</t>

      <section numbered="true" title="Update packing considerations">
        <t>BGP CT carries transport class as an attribute. This means routes
        that don't share the same transport class cannot be packed into same
        Update message. Update packing in BGP CT will be similar to RFC 8277
        family routes carrying attributes like communities or extended
        communities. Service families like SAFI 128 have considerably more
        scale than transport families like SAFI 4 or SAFI 76, which carry only
        loopbacks. Update packing mechanisms that scale for SAFI 128 routes
        will scale similarly for SAFI 76 routes also.</t>

        <t>The document <xref target="Intent-Routing-Color">Intent-aware
        Routing using Color </xref> section 6.3.2.1 suggests scaling numbers
        for transport network where BGP CT can be deployed. Experiments were
        conducted with this scale to find the convergence time with BGP CT for
        those scaling numbers. Scenarios involving BGP CT carrying IPv4 and
        IPv6 endpoints with MPLS label, and IPv6 endpoints with SRv6 SID were
        tested.</t>

        <t>Tests were conducted with 1.9 million BGP CT route scale (387K
        endpoints in 5 transport classes). Initial convergence time for all
        cases was less than 2 minutes, This experiment proves that carrying
        transport class information as an attribute keeps BGP convergence
        within acceptable range. Details of the experiment and test results
        are available in <xref target="BGP-CT-UPDATE-PACKING-TEST">BGP CT
        Update packing Test Results </xref>.</t>

        <t>Further, even in today's BGP LU deployments each egress node
        originates BGP LU route for it's loopback, with some attributes like
        community identifying the originating node or region, and AIGP
        attribute. These attributes may be unique per egress node, thus do not
        help with update packing in transport layer family routes.</t>

             title="Scaling using BGP MPLS Namespaces">
      <t>This section describes how scaling is achieved in an Inter domain
      MPLS network, where a domain is an AS or IGP area. Domain boundary is
      demarcated by a BN performing BGP nexthop self action on the transport
      route.</t>

      <t>It considers the scenario suggested in the document <xref
      target="Intent-Routing-Color">Intent-aware Routing using Color </xref>
      section 6.3.2.1. where 300K nodes exist in the network with 5 transport
      classes.</t>

      <t>This may result in 1.5M transport layer routes and MPLS transit
      routes in all Border Nodes in the network, which may overwhelm the
      nodes' MPLS forwarding resources.</t>

      <t>This section explains how mechanism described in <xref
      target="MPLS-NAMESPACES">MPLS Namespaces</xref> is used to scale such a
      network. This approach reduces the number of PNHs that are globally
      visible in the network, thus reducing forwarding resource usage network
      wide. Service route state is kept confined closer to network edge, and
      any churn is confined within the region containing the point of failure,
      which improves convergence.</t>

      <t>In order to achieve these scaling benefits, new functionality is
      required only at a Region's Border Nodes and the Regional RRs. All other
      nodes can remain legacy nodes, and still get the scaling and convergence
      benefits of this mechanism. This is mainly advantageous to ingress and
      egress PE devices which may be low end devices not capable of pushing
      deep label stacks or supporting large number of ECMP nexthops. They can
      enjoy the scaling benefits without needing software upgrades.</t>

      <section numbered="true" title="Illustration.">
        <t>Let us consider the decomposition of this example network with 300K
        nodes to be such that there are 300 domains containing 1000 nodes
        each. The mechanism described here will reduce the forwarding resource
        usage in all Border Nodes to become a function of number of domains
        (300) instead of number of nodes (300K). Thus, drastically reducing
        MPLS transit routes from 1.5M to 1500. The Border Nodes and Regional
        RRs in a Region do the job of abstracting the 1000 PE loopbacks from
        the rest of the network. The rest of the network sees this region as 1
        BGP nexthop, and not as 1000 BGP nexthops.</t>

        Domain2. Rest of the domains are not shown for brevity. The border
        nodes have forwarding state pertaining to all domains in the network.
        The control plane and forwarding plane state in node BN21 can be
        examined to determine the MPLS scaling characteristics of the
        network.</t>

        <t>L3VPN Service routes are present only at ingress and egress PEs.
        L3VPN family (SAFI 128) is negotiated between PE11..PE11000 and
        regional route reflector RR11. RR11 has multihop EBGP peering with
        RR31 and negotiates SAFI 128. RR31 further peers with all PEs
        PE31..PE31000 in Domain3.</t>

        <t>At the Transport layer - in Domain1, PE11..PE11000 negotiate BGP
        families (SAFI 4, SAFI 76) with BN11, BN12. In Domain2, BN11 and BN12
        similarly negotiate the transport families with BN21, which in turn
        peers with BN31 and BN32. In Domain3, BN31 and BN32 peer with PEs
        PE31..PE31000. Each of these BNs change BGP nexthop to self, when re
        advertising the SAFI 4, SAFI 76 transport routes.</t>

        <t>When all nodes loopback addresses are visible throughout the

      <section title="Context Protocol Nexthop Address (CPNH)">
        <t>A MPLS Namespace is identified by a Context PNH address. In MPLS
        forwarding, labels are locally significant to the node advertising it.
        E.g. labels in default/global MPLS Namespace are scoped by the node's
        loopback address. The labels belonging to a MPLS Namespace are locally
        significant in scope of the Context PNH address.</t>

        <t>A UHP label called as "Context Label" is advertised for the CPNH in
        a transport protocol, which points to the MPLS Namespace forwarding
        context. When Context label is received as outer label in a MPLS
        packet, it is Popped, and lookup is performed for the MPLS label that
        appears in the MPLS Namespace identified by the CPNH.</t>

        <t>In this example, CPNH is an anycast IP address that represents set
        of PEs in a domain. E.g. CPNH1 represent all PEs in Domain1. And CPNH3
        represents all PEs in Domain3.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Service Forwarding Helper, and changes to transport layer.">
        <t>The border nodes BN11, BN12 maintain the forwarding context for
        MPLS Namespace identified by CPNH1. They advertise CPNH1 in transport
        layer routes like SAFI-4 or SAFI-76 with a UHP Context Label CL1. Any
        transport layer protocol may be used to advertise the UHP Context
        Label for the CPNH.</t>

        <t>In this way, BN11 and BN12 serve as Service Forwarding Helpers for
        CPNH1 MPLS Namespace. They attract traffic that remote devices send
        towards the BGP nexthop CPNH1, and forward the MPLS packets received
        with the MPLS labels belonging to the MPLS Namespace identified by
        CPNH1.</t>

        <t>The individual loopback addresses of the PEs need not be advertised
        outside the local region. E.g. PE11..PE11000 are not advertised beyond
        BN11, BN12. Only CPNH1 and RR11 addresses are advertised out. RR1 is
        used for the control plane peering and CPNH1 is used as a forwarding
        anchor point.</t>

        <t>Similarly, Domain3 advertises only RR31 and CPNH3 to Domain2. This
        significantly reduces the transport route scale and MPLS forwarding
        resource usage at the border nodes throughout the network.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="BGP MPLS Namespace Address family (AFI:16399, SAFI:128)">
        <t>In Domain1, the regional route reflector RR11 negotiates MPLS
        Namespace Signaling address family with the border nodes BN11, BN12.
        RR11 is an external label allocator for the MPLS Namespace identified
        by CPNH1. RR1 advertises in the MPLS Namespace address family, the
        labels it allocated in scope of CPNH1. These routes are advertised
        with a route target that identifies CPNH1. BN11 and BN12 use this
        route target to import the label route into the forwarding context
        associated with CPNH1.</t>

        <t>Similarly, in Domain3, RR31 negotiates MPLS Namespace Signaling
        address family with the border nodes BN31, BN32.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Changes to Service Layer route exchange">
        <t>When RR11 re-advertises to RR31 a VPN route RD:Pfx1 received with
        label VL1 from egress PE11 in Domain1, it sets BGP nexthop to CPNH1,
        and advertises a new label PL1. This label PL1 is allocated within the
        scope of CPNH1 namespace.</t>

        <t>The label PL1 is advertised to BN1, BN2 in MPLS Namespace address
        family with a route target identifying CPNH1, and BGP nexthop PE11 and
        label VL1 that were received from the egress PE. BN1 and BN2 resolve
        the path to that BGP nexthop PE11 and use as nexthop for the PL1 route
        installed in CPNH1 forwarding context.</t>

        <t>The remote PEs in Domain3 consume the BGP updates from Domain1
        following regular procedures for SAFI 128. When resolving the BGP
        nexthop CPNH1, they will push the context label that lands the traffic
        into the correct forwarding context in one of the border nodes.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Analysis of forwarding behavior">
        <t>The forwarding behavior thus achieved is similar to Inter AS
        option-b, without carrying any service routes at the border nodes.
        Further, the MPLS namespace labels are installed in all the border
        nodes, which allows for quicker traffic convergence in case of border
        node failure. The number of border nodes can be increased in a scale
        out manner, which gives a cookie cutter template to scale a network
        region.</t>

        <t>In conclusion, this mechanism provides both scaling and convergence
        benefits for the MPLS network, and allows to support huge scale
        networks.</t>

          </list></t>

        <t>Architecturally, the forwarding semantic of End.REPLACE SID
        operation is similar to Label SWAP operation in MPLS data plane. When
        a route received with End SID (e.g. PE2-SRv6-gold or PE2-SRv6-bronze
        transport SIDs) is readvertised with nexthop self, a IPv6 forwarding
        entry is emitted with a forwarding semantic of End.B6.Encaps
        operation, which means: Update IPv6 DA with Next Segment in SRH, and
        Encapsulate SRv6 SID corresponding to the correct transport class.
        This can be seen in IPv6 FIB of ASBR2 during "BGP CT processing at
        ASBR2" in the following illustration:</t>

        <t>The following service layer SRv6 End.DT4 SIDs are provisioned:<list>
            <t>PE2-SRv6-S1-DT4 : PE2 End.DT4 SID for service S1</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The locators for above provisioned SRv6 SIDs will be advertised via
        ISIS between Intra-AS nodes and the established SRv6 tunnel to the
        node's loopback will be installed into the corresponding TRDB based on
        color.</t>

        <t>The SRv6 tunnel ingress routes are published in the Gold and Bronze

        <t>The operational, scaling and convergence aspects of this approach
        are similar to the aspects of applying BGP CT procedures to the MPLS
        data plane.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Color encoded Service SID (CPR) approach">
        <t>CPR is defined in the document: <xref
        target="Colorful-Prefix-Routing-SRv6">Colorful Prefix Routing for SRv6
        based services </xref>, and uses IPv6 Unicast (AFI/SAFI = 2/1) as a
        transport family. CPR mechanism does not use BGP CT (SAFI 76) address
        family.</t>

        <t>CPR uses color encoded service SRv6 SIDs, without a separate
        transport SRv6 SID. It routes using "Colorful Prefix" locators in the
        transport layer, which are carried in the IPv6 Unicast BGP family.</t>

        <t>BGP CT facilitates the CPR approach by providing intra domain
        intent-driven paths for the "Colorful Prefix" locator routes that
        carry a mapping community, by using <xref
        target="Nexthop_Resoln_Schm">Nexthop Resolution Scheme</xref> for
        those IPv6 unicast family routes.</t>

        <t>By virtue of the CPR SID allocation scheme, the service SIDs
        inherit the Intent of the corresponding Colorful Prefix route just by
        performing longest prefix match in forwarding plane.</t>

        <section title="Analysis of CPR approach">
          <t>The CPR approach can be used to support intent driven routing
          while minimizing SRv6 encapsulation overhead, at the cost of careful
          SID numbering and planning. The state in the transport network is a
          function of total number of Colorful Prefixes.</t>

          <t>In the CPR approach, a unique service SID is allocated for each
          combination of service function (e.g. Prefix, VRF or Nexthop) and
          Intent (Coloring Prefix) at the egress node.</t>

          <t>Such that per egress SN,</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork align="left" xml:space="preserve">

     Total_Num_Color_Prefixes = Num_Intents.
</artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>and,</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork align="left" xml:space="preserve">
     Total_Num_Service_SIDs = Num_Service_Functions  *  Num_Intents_Per_Service_Function.
</artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>In typical deployments, Num_Intents_Per_Service_Function may be
          equal to 1. Some deployments may provide per route granularity
          Intent, in such cases the value of Num_Intents_Per_Service_Function
          and Total_Num_Service_SIDs increases proportionally.</t>

          <t>This "Total_Num_Service_SIDs" scale may have an impact on overall
          convergence while executing operational procedures like Colorful
          Prefix locator modification, where the affected service routes have
          to be readvertised with their new Service SID computed as a result
          of the Colorful Prefix locator change.</t>

          <t>When an egress SN signals a change of Intent on service routes,
          that will involve per service route convergence in forwarding at the
          ingress SN because the Intent is encoded in the service SID.</t>

          <t>However, the CPR mechanism preserves BGP PIC (Prefix scale
          Independent Convergence) for the egress SN failure scenario where
          only Colorful Prefix routes need to be withdrawn.</t>

          <t>CPR achieves strict Intent based forwarding for the service
          routes. Fallback to best effort transport class is achieved by
          numbering all SRv6 Colorful Prefix locators at the egress SN to fall
          in the same subnet as the SRv6 locator that uses best effort
          transport class. Custom Intents that provide fallback between
          different color transport classes can be achieved by allocating a
          Colorful Prefix for each such intent combination, and advertising
          that Colorful Prefix route with an appropriate BGP CT mapping
          community, that maps to a customized resolution scheme.</t>

          <t>Further, IPv6 unicast family is widely deployed to carry Internet
          Service routes. Repurposing IPv6 unicast family to carry Transport
          routes also may impact the operational complexity and security
          aspects in the network.</t>
